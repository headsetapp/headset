[Headset](http://headsetapp.co) is a simple music player for Mac, Windows and Linux with integrated YouTube search, a home screen with popularity list by genres and eras, and best of all, a radio powered by Reddit. Headset takes the songs that are shared in over 80 music subreddits, categorizes them and plays them automatically. It's a great and pretty unique way to find new music as it is chosen by other humans like you and not by algorithms.

#### Build from source

If you would like to create a build for a different environment (e.g Manjaro or Aur, etc.) please follow these steps:

1. Install _NodeJs_ 8 or later

2. Clone the Repo
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/headsetapp/headset-electron.git
```
3. Install dependencies
```shell
$ cd headset-electron
$ npm ci
```

4. Create your build:
```shell
electron-packager . \
  --executable-name headset \
  --ignore "(^/bin$|^/sig$|^/gh-pages$|^/player$|^/test$|Procfile|\.md$|^\.|^\/\.)" \
  --prune true \
  --out build/ \
  --overwrite \
  --asar \
  --platform=linux \
  --arch=x64
```

5. [Optional] For the Ubuntu build, we're using `electron-installer-debian` and for the Fedora build, we're using `electron-installer-redhat`. There might be an installer for your specific version, just have to google it.
