# Contributing to Headset

Welcome to the Headset community!

## Community

We have two main channels of communication:
- our Slack workspace: https://tinyurl.com/y7m8y5x4
- issues on GitHub

If you have any questions on where to start and/or how to proceed, let us know!

## Ways to contribute

We welcome many ways of contributing to Headset:
- finding bugs and [reporting issues](https://github.com/headsetapp/headset-electron/issues)
- picking and working on an existing [issue](https://github.com/headsetapp/headset-electron/labels/help-wanted) marked as 
  "help wanted"
- proposing and implementing improvements to Headset

## Setting up the environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub

2. Clone your fork of the repository

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/headset-electron.git
  ```

3. Installation is OS-dependent, so choose the appropriate OS directory:
  - `windows` for Windows
  - `darwin` for OSX
  - `linux` for Linux

    To install all the required dependencies run:

    ```shell
    npm i; cd <os>; npm i
    ```

    which will install both global and OS-dependent packages.


4. Now you can run the app:

  ```shell
  npm run production-like
  ```

You are ready to pick a "help wanted" issue and start working on it.

## Testing

Whenever you work on a new feature, be sure to add appropriate tests. Before 
submitting your changes, you should run all the test suites to make sure it works
as expected.

1. Linter tests

    To run linter tests use this command in the root directory
    ```shell
    npm run lint <directory>
    ```
    where `<directory>` is either the OS you are working on (`darwin`, `linux`, 
    `windows`), the `test` folder, or the `shared` folder. If you work on multiple OSs 
    (or directories), you can run the same `npm run lint` followed by a list of all 
    directories separated by spaces e.g. 
    ```shell
    npm run lint linux windows shared
    ```

2. General test suites

    Run 
    ```shell
    npm run test:<os>
    ```
    where `<os>` is either `darwin`, `linux` or `windows`. If you're working on 
    multiple OSs, the command has to be run for each OS. Remember that the tests are
    OS-specific - you need to run them on the sytem you're testing for, using either
    physical or virtual machines.

## Merging your changes

We work in a pull request driven flow. If you don't know how to make a PR,
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) is a GitHub doc on it.

It's best to talk about code and share it early, so you can make a pull request 
even if you haven't finished - it's much easier to improve once other contributors can
see the code! Just make sure to write it in the pull request message and ask for help.

To submit a pull request:
- create a feature branch locally and commit all your changes to it
- run all the relevant tests (linter and general), fix any issues
- push them to a feature branch on your fork - if you do `git push origin     <branch-name>`
  GitHub will automatically create a new branch for you
- go to your GitHub fork, switch to the feature branch and submit a pull request to
  the main repository

Make sure to add relevant information, e.g.:
- which issue you are working on - you can link it using `#<issue-number>` in your message
- which parts of the feature you'd like some feedback on
- where you got stuck if you need help
